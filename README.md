# Vehicle-Position-Simulator
This program was done as a project for my computer programming in engineering applications 
II class. This program takes several inputs, primarily direction and velocity, in order to
simulate the position and state of a moving car. This program is a great representation of
my ability to use object oriented programming and create a program which can vary greatly
depending on the input data.
